**Description:**
A 2D shooter game. The player's ship moves along the X-axis at the bottom of the screen, 
firing projectiles at fleets of enemy ships above it. The player's task is to destroy each
ship through the projectiles fired, thereby increasing his score and collecting in-game currency. 
After gaining certain score metrics, the player has the option to upgrade his ship in various 
aspects with the earned currency. The game runs indefinitely, ending after running out of lives 
after hitting enemy ships, or by quitting the application by pressing the Exit button, which 
appears after pressing the settings button.
